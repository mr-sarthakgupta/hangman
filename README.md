# Hangman with Canine Transformer

This project implements the classic Hangman game, enhanced with a machine learning twist using the Canine Transformer model. The Canine Transformer is leveraged to predict the next likely character, making the game more intelligent and interactive.

## How It Works

- The core game logic follows the traditional Hangman rules.
- The Canine Transformer model is integrated to analyze the current game state and recommend the next character guess.
- With this approach, the system achieves approximately **66% accuracy** in correctly guessing the words in the Hangman game.
